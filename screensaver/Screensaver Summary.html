<Marquee scrolldelay= 10 Direction=Left><h1>This screensaver uses an API function to call images from giphy.com.</h1></Marquee>

<Marquee scrolldelay= 10 Direction=Left><h1>The idea behind this screensaver is to infinitely produce multiple images that make you feel intense and stresses you out. </h1></Marquee>

<Marquee scrolldelay= 10 Direction=Left><h1>While most screensavers are expected to be calming, my screensaver juxtaposes the concept with stressful,  gorey scenes.</h1></Marquee>

<Marquee scrolldelay= 10 Direction=Left><h1>The layout of this screensaver is purposely meant to cause stress and continue on a loop. </h1> </Marquee>

<Marquee scrolldelay= 10 Direction=Left><h1>The visuals are meant to be purposely upsetting because with most screensavers, the viewer would not expect having to watch the content for long periods of time. </h1> </Marquee>

<Marquee scrolldelay= 10 Direction=Left><h1>Although the images appear to be changing, they are actually just appending more images randomly from the API source.</h1></Marquee>
