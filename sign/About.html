<h2>About</h2>
<p>In 1939 The Museum of Non-Objective Painting opened its rented quarters at 24 East 54th Street, showcasing the collection of American and European abstract and nonobjective artworks that Solomon R. Guggenheim had begun assembling a decade before. In the seventy years since, the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum—renamed in its founder’s honor in 1952 and housed since 1959 in Frank Lloyd Wright’s iconic building on Fifth Avenue—has grown exponentially, expanding in both historical and stylistic range and depth. The special collections listed below represent several of the major historical additions to the collection, but by no means encompass the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum’s complete holdings.</p>
