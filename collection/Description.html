<p>	The layout of this site is a collection of found tattoos from different people. I wanted to showcase these tattoos anonymously so that just the images of the tattoos would be important rather than the people who owned them. I decided to also create a layout that was more hidden to reveal tattoos similarly to how in everyday society not everyone can tell who has tattoos unless they are exposed. The overall page becimes a personal study and it has been strange in a sense to collect parts of others that you know personally.</p>
