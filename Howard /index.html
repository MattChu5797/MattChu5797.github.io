<h1> JAMES HOWARD</h1>
<div class="portriat"><img src="man-clone-swirl-james-howard.jpg"></div>
<p> James Howard ​was born in 1981 in Canterbury, UK. He is considered as a hacker-turned-artist who considers the use of Internet junk. 
<br>Howard studied Fine Art at the University of Reading, and subsequently at the Royal Academy, London and graduated in 2007. 
<br> Starting in the late 90's, he was a notorious teenage hacker and began to gain access to highly secure foreign government networks 
<br> via dial-up Internet connection. 
He uncovered terrifying documents “that rewrote the origin and development of human life” which led 
<br> to his inspiration and fascination with re-assembling reality via concepts of becoming, fluidity, and art. These digital pieces are usually 
<br>produced as wall-sized installations and have been exhibited at museums and galleries internationally, including Barbican Center, 
<br> London, UK; The Frankfurter Kunstverein, Germany; The Saatchi Gallery, London, 
UK, and Les Rencontres d'Arles, France, envoy enterprises, 
<br> New York City, USA; and Duve Gallery, Berlin, Germany. His work has been featured on BBC, Rhizome.com, The Guardian, Artinfo, The Independent, 
<br> and The Times amongst many other outlets. 
He currently lives and works in Tokyo, Japan
