<h1>Summary Page of Text Project</h1>

<p> The concept of my web page is meant to be interactive. It is a mockup of a kind of 
<br>generator that you would usually find online. The idea includes going through pages which allow you 
<br>to choose words to “build” a desired presentation. The structure of the page is meant to seem
 <br>mundane, dry,  and bare as a user would slowly work their way through before realizing that each 
 <br>page is different, and the task of going through new words, same words with little to no 
  <br>information is intriguing. By the end of the piece, the user will be asked to fill in all their  
  <br>choices at once in a test of either memorization or if any of their choices and opinions changed  
  <br>throughout the course of selecting words. 
<br>
 <br>Once the user completes the final page of selecting words, they will be able to see their  
 <br>presentation take form, which is in reality becomes the inaugural speech for president Trump with 
  <br>the words that the user chose. At this time, the user will also be able to compare their own  
  <br>selections and the outcomes in comparison to how accurate the actual speech is written. The  idea 
  <br> behind the entire layout is meant to reflect how people choose online quizzes or generators where <br> they just pick, click, choose, and plug in different choices and items and the idea that if the user  
  <br>
  is going through a website which creates an answer or product for them, are they really in control of  <br>the decision they have made? With this presentation generator, it shows that the outcome of the  
  <br>presentation is just a predetermined template and the choices given are just to plug in and these  <br>options are the only thing the user necessarily has control of even though the choices themselves  <br>are also predetermined by the structure of the website.
